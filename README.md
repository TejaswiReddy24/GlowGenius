# GlowGenius

**GlowGenius** is a skincare ingredient recommendation system that helps users discover **what** active ingredients they should use and **why** â€” based on their skin concerns.

## ðŸ’¬ What It Does

Just tell GlowGenius what you're dealing with â€” acne, dark spots, fine lines, you name it â€” and itâ€™ll recommend ingredients that can help.

For each ingredient, youâ€™ll get:
- **What it is** (a short intro)
- **What it does** (the real benefits)
- **Who itâ€™s good for** (skin types/concerns)
- **Who should skip it** (in case itâ€™s not for everyone)

Basically, skincare simplified.



## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

The magic behind GlowGenius comes from a Kaggle dataset that was web-scraped from a skincare site. It includes:
- Tons of ingredients
- What they do
- Who they work best for
- Any red flags to know about


## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TejaswiReddy24/GlowGenius.git
